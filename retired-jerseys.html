        <img class="image2" align="left" src="https://publish.nba.com/lakers/sites/lakers/files/retired_numbers_kobe.jpg">
        <p align="left">In a career that spanned two decades, Kobe Bryant rewrote NBA history while leading the Lakers to the summit of the NBA.

Drafted by Charlotte when he was only 17 years old, Bryant was quickly traded to the Lakers, who believed in his potential to become a superstar.</p>
        <p align="left">Five championships. One MVP. Eighteen All-Star selections. Eleven First Team All-NBA nods. Nine All-Defensive First Team honors. Four All-Star Game MVPs. Two Finals MVPs. One Slam Dunk Contest title.

And while he has scored the third-most points in league history (33,643), Bryant also sits as the Lakers’ all-time leader in several categories, including games (1,346), minutes (48,637), 3-pointers (1,827), free throws (8,378) and steals (1,944).</p>
        <p align="left">But perhaps the greatest number of Bryant’s career is 20 — the number of seasons he represented the Lakers and no other team.</p>
